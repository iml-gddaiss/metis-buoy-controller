.New Features

.TODO
... Set SuccesfulWinchMessage
... Set WinchMaxFileLength

... Review all Failed_Sampling_Error (especially WMT700 AN -> NAN)
.... Should WXT536 have 3 sampling alerts (Wind, Weather, Rain) 

... Add better Docstring
.... The Main file should have description of the overall scan logic.
.... For each instrument script, doc string should be added in the file header to 
    describe: 
        + What devices are compatible. (model/firmware)
        + How the device sample.
        + What are/do the different command.
        + Any additionnal thing to know.
.... Add script depency (on other script variables) in the script doc strings

.. DataTables
... Add units to every table. 
... Set proper type ? maybe Probably not nescessary since we can remove the double quotes on collecting.
